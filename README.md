lets talk about the navigation bar, on the right side of it you can see a drop down menu which you can use to go to your profile, logout from your account, and an inbox which you can see all the messages that you have sent to other users and chat with them live, on the navigation bar you can see the contact us tab which you can use to reach us, and the services tab which is a drop down menu which you can use to navigate to matches, travel plans and activities.
